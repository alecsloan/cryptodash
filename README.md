# Todo
* Add a light theme
* Add full configuration for color picking so users can set their own colors/gradients
* Add setting for sorting cards (Market Cap, holdings, price, etc)
* Add multi-language support
* Get list of tokens dynamically, using a static list of tokens is limiting
* Add functionality for interest bearing assets
* Add functionality for exit strategy planning
* Add timestamp for last time data was updated
* Make it more clear that prices and value changes were updated (maybe similar to what CMC does?)
* Add link to CMC/CG page if someone clicks on the asset name/symbol
* Add configuration for hiding CryptoDash title
* Add Image caching
